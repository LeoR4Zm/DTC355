    <h1>HTML Semantic Tags</h1>

    <p>
        In HTML, <strong>non-semantic tags</strong> are tags that do not describe their meaning or role in the
        document. For example, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> are generic containers that simply
        group content, but they give no information about what that content represents.
        <br><br>
        By contrast, <strong>semantic tags</strong> describe the meaning and purpose of the content they contain.
        Examples include <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>,
        and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. These elements tell both developers and browsers what role the content plays.

    <h2>Benefits of Semantic Tags</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Improved Accessibility:</strong> Screen readers and assistive technologies can better interpret 
            content, helping users with disabilities navigate pages more easily.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO (Search Engine Optimization):</strong> Search engines can more effectively understand the 
            structure and importance of content, leading to higher rankings.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Maintainability:</strong> Code becomes more organized and easier for developers to read, 
            understand, and maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Future-Proofing:</strong> As web standards evolve, semantic tags are more likely to remain 
            compatible.</li>
    </ol>
